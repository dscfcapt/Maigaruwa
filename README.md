# Maigaruwa
A platform for All water vendors in kano to register for easy access to customers. Wtaer Vendor popolarly know as maigaruwa always have to push their truck from one street to another in search of customers to buy the water in jerry can. Dsc fcapt members went to 3 water depots station where the vendors fetch water to talk to interview some of them and talk to the station manager.
After the interview we realize there are two problem the water vendors faced:
- Having to move around with truck from one street to another, and after they sell it they will have to come back to that station and fetch another.
- 95% of them dont have smart phones.

Stating all these dec fcapt members thik of solution by creating a web platform for all garuwa members to register on it. so that all their customers leaving in that area can be able to call them( considering limitation to smart phone).
